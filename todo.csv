6,pending, change,firmware,send_cmd function should return the reply in one input parameter then it should clear the receive buffer.
2,pending, issue,firmware, sim_tcp_send is not stable.  it tries to send without knowing if the GPRS connection is still available.
1,pending,change,firmware,sim_mqtt_publish should accept any message to any topic with any client ID. it must reply 1 if message is successfully sent and 0 otherwise.
3,pending, task,firmware, implement debug mode. 
4,pending, task,firmware, implement watchdog
5,pending, task,firmware, add doxygen comments to the implementation file
13,pending,change,firmware,"grps_enable must connect to grps network reliabely using the 2 stages, attach then activate PDP context. jumping from one state to the other must be progressive. If failure oocur at any level retry the operation"
14,pending,change,firmware,to solve issue ID 1 sim_tcp_send should check the GPRS status before trying to send data. if there is an issue with GPRS then GPRS reconnect must be called first.
17,pending,change,firmware,change the main program so that it collects position and speed data every 10 seconds and stores the new values if the traveled distance is superior than 10 meters and then sends the data to the server every minute
15,pending,task,firmware,Create a function that checks the GPRS status
16,pending,task,firmware,implement sleep mode on the MCU and SIM808
18,pending,task,firmware,develop the main so that the board sends a status report every T duration (30 min or 1h) to a status MQTT topic. Report includes : board temperature - uptime - cell signal strength - visible GPS sattelites - ping duration
8,done,task,hardware,develop PSU circuit
9,pending,task,hardware,develop stm32 and sim808 functional circtuit
10,done,task,hardware,develop stm32 development PCB board with swd/gpio/uart pins
11,pending,task,hardware,develop minimalistic sim808 PCB development board
